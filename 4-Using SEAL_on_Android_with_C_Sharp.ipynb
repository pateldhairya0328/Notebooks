    "# Using Microsoft SEAL on Android\n",
    "\n",
    "With Xamarin, and the Microsoft SEAL NuGet package, we are able to to develop Android applications incorporating homomorphic encryption using .NET. But before we jump into the Android app development, we will begin with writing a simple C# program that will be transferred to the Android app. This program will consist of repeatedly encrypting, then decrypting a number, and measuring the time taken on average to encrypt and decrypt the number once. This is a very important time to know, as it can be the bottleneck in the frequency a certain operation can run with on a phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we need to import some libraries that we will be using. We need to get the NuGet packaged for Microsoft SEAL, as well as the System.Diagnostics class which will help us in timing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Do not include `#r \"nuget:Microsoft.Research.SEALNet, 3.5.1\"` in actual C# code. That is jupyter specific code for importing the NuGet package. Follow steps on the Microsoft SEAL GitHub to set up an environment to use SEAL with C#/.NET."
