If you do not have Anaconda on your device, go to the [Anaconda distribution page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install the latest version for Linux for Python 3.7. Once you have Anaconda ready to go, we will create a conda environment, which I call `customtf`, and then activate it. The command to do this in the terminal is\n",
